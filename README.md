## About

This is a convenience package for building the FPL "nonlinear optimization"
package, commonly appearing in project libraries as purpose-built archives
named "opt77.jar" or "optimization.jar".  It contains the sixteen Java
source files listed in the "Installation" section at the above URL, last
modified March 10, 2010, at the time of this writing, May 14, 2014.

This package is a dependency of the Carnegie Mellon University TETRAD project.

See the above website and code comments for licensing details.

## Building

Assuming Maven is installed, a "mvn install" executed from the project's root
directory should suffice, which will create the file "opt77.jar", among other
things, in the target/ subdirectory.
